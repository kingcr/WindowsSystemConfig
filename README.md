# WindowsSystemConfig

(Yet another) set of scripts for post-install configuration of Windows 10.

This project contains my preferences in terms of Windows 10 personalisation, with a privacy-focused slant.

Settings are targeted at Windows 10 1803 Professional. Previous versions of Windows 10 have different setting values in some cases, and not all settings will work on Home. Because Microsoft tends to change settings and values frequently, the intention of these scripts is to enable configuration to be maintained in a categorised, extensible way.
